# DistMap: single cell spatial distributed mapping 

## About
This `R` package is created and maintained by Nikos Karaiskos.
DistMap can be used to spatially map single cell RNA sequencing data
by using an existing reference database of in situs.

## Installation
The easiest way to install `DistMap` is through `devtools`

```
library(devtools)
install_github("rajewsky-lab/DistMap")
```

## Usage

### Reading the data
Pay extra attention if you read data with different commands, for instance
`read.table` against `fread` from the `data.table` package. Gene names which
contain `-`s or other special characters might be read differently. In that
case you'll probably encounter an error during binarization of the data (see
below).

### Mapping the data
The `DistMap` object is used to store the following structures:
* `raw.data`, the raw data (e.g. UMI counts) of the experiment, provided
by the user as a matrix with genes as rows and cells as columns.
* `data` is the normalized data, provided by the user as a matrix similar
to the raw data.
* `binarized.data` is the binarized version of the single cell data 
computed via the `binarizeSingleCellData` function.
* `insitu.matrix` is the matrix of the reference database, provided by
the user, with genes as columns and positions (bins) as rows. See the
included example used in the paper.
* `geometry`, a matrix containing the cartesian coordinates of each bin
in three dimensional space. Provided by the user, bins as rows and coordinates
as columns, see `geometry.txt.` provided as an example.

The first step is to initialize the `DistMap` object
```
dm = new("DistMap",
         raw.data=raw.data,
         data=normalized.data,
         insitu.matrix=insitu.matrix,
         geometry=geometry)
```
Then the binarized single cell data is computed and the cells are mapped
onto the reference atlas
```
dm <- binarizeSingleCellData(dm, seq(0.15, 0.5, 0.01))
dm <- mapCells(dm)
```
Once the cells have been mapped, the `DistMap` functions can be used
to compute a vISH or a gradient of a gene and visualize the expression
pattern
```
computeVISH(dm, 'sna', threshold=0.75)
computeGeneGradient(dm, 'sna')
```
